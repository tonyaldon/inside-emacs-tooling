# About

In `inside-emacs-tooling`, you'll find `emacs-lisp` tooling
I use to make the video series [INSIDE EMACS](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQCrbWOFRmFYqoeou0Qv3Kg).

# Motivation

1. Automate boring and repetitive part of making the videos,
2. Drastically cut down the time to produce the video,
3. Trying to produce each video in less than 2 hours (it currently
   takes me 8 to 10 hours)
